## 2. Background

- **Total Market Value:** $1.6 trillion in the U.S. as of 2023
- **Market Channels :** Dealerships , Private Sales , Online Platforms

**Personal Experience with Used Car Pricing**
- Pricing was overwhelming when searching for a used car.
- No reliable method to verify correct pricing.
- Relied on word of mouth for pricing validation.


**Why does it matter?**
- This project addresses the common challenge of pricing uncertainty for both buyers and sellers.


**Research questions**
1. Prediction Accuracy
Can machine learning models outperform traditional pricing heuristics in accurately predicting used car values, especially in high-demand vehicle categories like electric, Gasoline and hybrid models?
2. Depreciation Analysis
How does the depreciation rate vary across different car makes and models over time?

**Future Scope :**
1. Maintenance Cost Prediction
Can we predict the maintenance costs for the used cars?


## 3. Data 

Describe the datasets you are using to answer your research questions.

- Data source : Cars.com
- Data size (2.9 MB)
- Data shape (14420 and 15 columns)
- **Each row represents a single car listing from a dealership**
- Data dictionary

- Which variable/column will be your target/label in your ML model?
  Price_usd

## 5. Model Training 

- What models you will be using for predictive analytics?
- How will you train the models?
  - Train vs test split (80/20, 70/30, etc.)
  - Python packages to be used (scikit-learn, NLTK, spaCy, etc.)
  - The development environments (your laptop, Google CoLab, GitHub CodeSpaces, etc.)
- How will you measure and compare the performance of the models?

## 6. Application of the Trained Models

Develop a web app for people to interact with your trained models. Potential tools for web app development:

- **Streamlit** (recommended for its simplicity and ease to learn)
- Dash
- Flask

## 7. Conclusion

- Summarize your work and its potetial application
- Point out the limitations of your work
- Lessons learned 
- Talk about future research direction
